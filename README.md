A program to explore image manipulation and generation using standard Python libraires.

The program is intended as a learning tooll as well as a practical tool for processing images.

Some key ideas are:
1. Configurability of tooling
2. Extensibility of toolset / library set
3. Pipeline processing for image processing / manipulation and generation
4. Support for a range of image formats
